I'm working as Software Engineering Manager at [trexDCAS](https://trex.com.tr/en/home/). My team is developing Industry 4.0, Industrial IoT and  MES solutions.

I maintain and contribute to couple of [open source projects](https://github.com/aliozgur) and published an open source **Git 101 book in Turkish** ([Read Online](https://aliozgur.gitbook.io/git101/) \| [Download PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/947k3c4rvid0drr/aliozgur_git101_book.pdf?dl=0)).

I authored of the following printed books.

* [Git ile Versiyon Kontrolü](https://www.dikeyeksen.com/products/git-ile-versiyon-kontrolu)
* [F# ile Fonksiyonel Programlama](https://www.dikeyeksen.com/products/f-ile-fonksiyonel-programlama)


I'm an organized, diciplined, self motivated and productive person. During my professional career I was involved with lot's of projects in very different industries. I had the chance to work with great people and I liked every second I spent on any single bit of code I've written. I love to share what I know or what I think is important with my colleagues. In terms of software development, team work or organizational relations you can name me as a social personality though my wife thinks I'm an introvert who likes to listen to Heavy Metal.
